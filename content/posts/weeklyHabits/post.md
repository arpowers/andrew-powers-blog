> Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. <br>**- Aristotle**

I always try and create templates for tasks that need to be repeated week after week. As they say "success is not an act, but a habit."

Here are a few standards I follow as I go through the week.

- **Don't drink during the week.** Doing so will affect work and ability to stay fit.
- **Write every day.** This will help refine knowledge and perhaps build an audience.
- **Read every night.** It keeps you up to date with new ideas, how to respond to change, and best practices for whatever goal is important at the time.
- **Think on paper.** Formalize your research, people often over estimate their ability to retain information.
- **Use spreadsheets** Spreadsheets are a necessary way of making sense of data. Whenever possible put information into a spreadsheet. Don't rely on apps, or other fast food data.
- **Use an inbox/todo-list** From Getting Things Done, this helps reduce stress along with helping you stay on top of everything you need to do.
- **Use a calendar** Also from Getting Things Done, any time oriented activity belongs on the calendar. It is essentially the time-based ToDo list.
- **Take vitamins, drink water** As you get older supplements become more important to wellness. I take Vitamin B, D, along with aminos (Glutamine), LongJack (for testosterone stimulation)
- **Social media only once a day, No messaging during the day.** Try and stay away from social media and messaging during the day. If you don't you can easily waste hours on mindless browsing or conversation.
- **Work out every morning or night** Work out to keep hormones and energy at healthy levels. Also to retain a feeling of wellness.
- **Eliminate the unnecessary (80/20)** Try and remove things from the schedule that are unimportant. Don't optimize for things you shouldn't do in the first place.
- **Set number driven goals** When setting goals, make sure they have a metric or number attached to them.
- **Set deadlines and keep them** Goals all should have a deadline or reconciliation date associated with them. This prevents scope creep, and ultimately helps with focus and course correction.
