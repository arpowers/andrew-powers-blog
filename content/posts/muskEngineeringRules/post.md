There are mistakes common to most big/complex projects. Most of them are no single person's fault, but a fault of the natural realities of working with many people.

Elon Musk has a great system for dealing with this. He summarizes it in 5 steps (video below)...

Here they are:

## Make Requirements Less Dumb

A project's requirements are it's design constraints and goals. There are many reasons they can be "dumb."

From my experience, requirement problems often come from a general poor understanding of the customer's true pain points and incentives. In Musk's, often requirements are dictated by physics.

Requirements are never perfect. But often they are based on assumptions or experiences across many people.

So when many people are involved it becomes important to "trust" what they've added the requirements or you end up reinventing them in every project. But as Musk states, some requirements could be from an intern who made it up years ago.

For that reason, you should continually audit and reconsider requirements given to you for any project

## Delete Parts or Process

Now that you've done your best to ensure your goals are correct. Ask yourself: what can be removed from the design or process?

Without vigilance projects will always become bloated with features.

The less someone understands the entirety of a system; the harder it is for them to remove components of a system. That's why its safer to add a feature than to remove one. At least you know what the feature you added is for.

Many projects have failed because they just strapped on too many "in case" features.

## Simplify and Optimize

Now that you've refined requirements and deleted useless parts/process you can work to simplify what remains.

It is important this always comes after the first two steps, as the ultimate waste of time is to optimize something that shouldn't exist in the first place.

Musk discusses how he spent millions trying to fix a protective plate for Tesla batteries. After asking around he found tha the battery team thought it was for noise protection, while the noise team thought it was for fire protection. In the end, it served no purpose at all and only existed due to bad requirements and poor cross department communication.

## Accelerate Cycle Time

Often it's so important to get the first three steps right, that you've gotten used to working slowly and carefully. But at this point, you need to ramp up speed and use your planning to enable fast 'cycle' time.

This often appears as "analysis paralysis" where people work to perfect their plans to the point where they never implement anything.

## Automate

The final step is to automate your process. The most interesting thing about this step is that you need to leave it til the end.

Lots of engineers like myself tend to start thinking about the interesting scaling issues in the beginning. This is because you know how important they are to the overall "business" success; however, with a proper understanding of this process you should see why thinking about this last is important.
